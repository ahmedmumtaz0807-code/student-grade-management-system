    print("Bulking ?\n")
    print('''Bulking is a nutrition and training phase focused on gaining muscle mass by consuming more calories than the body burns while following a structured strength-training program. The goal is to provide the body with enough energy and nutrients—especially protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats—to support muscle growth and recovery. During a bulk, individuals typically lift heavier weights, progressively increase training volume, and prioritize adequate sleep to maximize muscle gains. While some fat gain is normal due to the calorie surplus, a well-planned bulk aims to minimize excess fat by using clean, nutrient-dense foods and carefully tracking intake and progress.\n''')
    print("Cutting ?\n")
    print('''Cutting is a phase focused on reducing body fat while preserving as much muscle mass as possible. It involves consuming fewer calories than the body burns, combined with consistent strength training and often increased cardiovascular activity. Protein intake is kept high to support muscle retention, while carbohydrates and fats are adjusted to maintain energy and hormonal balance. The main challenge during cutting is finding the right calorie deficit—large enough to promote fat loss but small enough to avoid muscle loss, fatigue, or strength decline.\n''')
    print("To Gain Muscle ?\n")
    print('''To gain muscle, the body needs a consistent combination of progressive strength training, adequate nutrition, and proper recovery. Resistance training creates small tears in muscle fibers, which then repair and grow stronger when fueled by sufficient calories—especially protein—and carbohydrates for energy. Eating in a slight calorie surplus, training each muscle group regularly, progressively increasing weights or volume, and getting enough sleep are all essential for maximizing muscle growth over time.\n''')

# Diet plan for the customers 

print("What diet actually is ?\n")
print("A diet plan is a structured guide that outlines what, when, and how much a person should eat in order to achieve a specific health or fitness goal. It is designed to provide the body with the right amount of calories and nutrients needed for energy, growth, recovery, and overall well-being. A diet plan takes into account factors such as age, body weight, activity level, and goals like muscle gain, fat loss, or maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Rather than being about strict restrictions, an effective diet plan focuses on balanced meals, proper portion sizes, and consistency, helping individuals develop sustainable eating habits that support long-term health and performance.\n")
print("What is Calories?\n")
print("Calories are the foundation of weight management and body transformation, as they represent the energy the body uses to function, train, and recover. A calorie surplus occurs when daily intake exceeds energy expenditure, which is necessary for building muscle, improving strength, and supporting recovery from intense workouts because the body requires extra fuel to repair and grow muscle tissue. However, if the surplus is too large or poorly managed, it can also lead to unwanted fat gain. On the other hand, a calorie deficit happens when the body burns more calories than it consumes, prompting it to draw energy from stored fat, which results in weight loss. While a deficit is effective for fat reduction, it must be carefully controlled to preserve muscle mass, maintain strength, and prevent fatigue. By adjusting calorie intake based on goals—using a surplus for muscle growth and a deficit for fat loss—individuals can strategically shape their physique while supporting long-term performance and health.\n")
print("Benefits of getting a proper diet ?\n")
print("A healthy diet offers many advantages that support both physical and mental well-being. It helps maintain a healthy body weight by providing the right balance of calories and nutrients, reducing the risk of obesity and related diseases. A proper diet improves energy levels and daily performance by supplying the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients. It also supports muscle growth, strength, and recovery, especially when combined with regular physical activity. Additionally, a balanced diet strengthens the immune system, improves digestion, and lowers the risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Over time, following a good diet promotes better focus, improved mood, and long-term overall health.\n")
